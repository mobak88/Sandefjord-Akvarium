# Documentation

I decided to use the CSS @import rule as a workaround that allows me to make a component like structure. I have also given the images that have an alt atribute and that are not hidden for screen readers a norwegian name because of SEO, I think most visitors comes from Norway, eventhough some might be tourists. I also spent a little bit of extra time on making sure the background of the menu items is clickable for accessibility purposes.
