I decided to use the CSS @import rule as a workaround that allows me to make a component like structure. I have also given the images that have an alt atribute and that are not hidden for screen readers a norwegian name because of SEO, I think most visitors comes from Norway, eventhough some might be tourists. I also spent a little bit of extra time on making sure the background of the menu items is clickable for accessibility purposes. I did not include icons for contact info or include social links because that would have required me to attribute the creator on the site eventhough it would be ideal for the look to include them.
