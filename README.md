I decided to use the CSS @import Rule because importing multiple render blocking calls in the head slows down the initial page load time, and the @import is a workaround that allows me to make a component like structure. I have also given the images that have an alt atribute and that are not hidden for screen readers a norwegian name because of SEO, I think most visitors comes from Norway, eventhough some might be tourists. Also there is an error message regarding unsupported MIME type, that I did not find a solution for.
